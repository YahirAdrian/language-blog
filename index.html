            <p>Language learning is a complex process that takes time to learners to be able to acquire the vocabulary, grammar, and to speak the language at a good level. When we learn a foreign language, we can find some difficulties in the learning process that may cause some problems, it varies depending on the language we want to learn. It is known that some languages are more difficult to learn than others, but it is hard to measure in what extent it could make the learners struggle in the learning process. The languages are organized in a language tree according to their origin and similarity, also some researchers have created methods to measure the linguistic distance to know how hard would be to learn a language in relation to the mother tongue. In addition, there are some language general and individual differences that learners might encounter when they learn a foreign language. These differences can affect the learner&rsquo;s probability to learn the target language in a shorter or longer period of time. However, the foreign language learners can use some strategies in order to enhance their learning in case of learning a &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; language</p>

            <h3 id="language-trees">Language trees</h3>
            <p>The languages are classified into family trees that organizes the languages in groups called families according to their grammatical structure and origin because the languages evolve through the time and form families. &ldquo;Through a language tree one may, in principle, trace the evolution of languages although linguists differ in their construction of language trees&rdquo; (Chiswick &amp; Miller, 2005, p. 2). With the language tree we can identify the origin of a language following its derivates along the branches of the tree; when two languages are situated in the same branch, they have some similarities that make them easy to learn and sometimes they can ineligibles This makes languages intelligible and easy to learn among languages of the same branch as Spanish and Portuguese that allows two people understand each other despite of the fact that they are speaking two different languages. When a person tries to learn a language of a different branch that has a different origin and structure, they may encounter some problems in the learning process because they have different structure, pronunciation grammatical rules and writing styles.</p>

            <h3 id="linguistic-distance">Linguistic distance</h3>
            <p>It is hard to determine to what extend a language is more difficult to learn than other, therefore there have been much research about measuring the linguistic distance among languages using methods because knowing the language trees is not enough to measure the linguistic distance. Chiswick &amp; Miller (2005), defined linguistic distance as &ldquo;the extent to which languages differ from each other&rdquo; (p.1), they said that it is hard to measure it because languages differ in vocabulary, grammar, syntax, written form, among others (p.3), they developed a quantitative measure of the language distance of English an other languages and in their results they scored the languages finding Afrikaans, Danish Dutch, French and German as easier languages and Japanese, Korean and Cantonese as harder languages.</p>
            <h4>Literature review</h4>
            <p>When someone wants to learn a language that differ of their mother tongue, they can encounter with some problems in their learning process. Yang &amp; Duan (2016) analyzed the difficulties of Chinese students in their academic English, and they found that they had four main difficulties: differences between CALP and BICS, accent, speed, and cultural aspects (p. 47). They might have encountered these problems due to the cultural differences and the influence of English in their country before being involved by the real language.</p>
            <p>Another example of difficulties found in the literature review was the difficulties learning Chinese in UK students, and study made by Hu (2010) that showed these difficulties collected from a survey applied to Chinese Foreign Learners to analyze 34 aspects of learning Chinese. The findings were that the most difficult aspect of the language for students was expressing their ideas in the new language and aspects related to the fluency.</p>

            <h3 id="general-factors">General factors that affect language learning</h3>
            <p>There are some general factors that can make easy or difficult to learn a language. A clear example for learning but which could also be a general difficulty is motivation within the classroom in this case, Graham (1984) explains the concept of "assimilative" motivation by adding a theory about what he considers the most suitable way to develop a perfect type of motivation.</p>
            <p>Another factor that can help in learning a second language is group work, which is one of the most effective ways in the classroom, since through this technique the student is stimulated by his peers, by this means he can learn new vocabulary, reinforce his pronunciation, and share new points of view that can be beneficial not only on an academic level but also on a social and cultural level.</p>
          </article>

          <article>
            <h3 id="individual-factors">Individual factors that affect language learning</h3>
            <p>In regard of the individual factors, we can distinguish from the research done by the neurologists Penfield and Roberts (1959). They built on earlier research by Broca (1861), who observed that lesions in a particular area of the left hemisphere could lead to a loss in the faculty of speech. Penfield and Roberts explain that children's brains are composed of an enormous plasticity that will decrease as they grow.</p>
<p>The age factor is very important, it is scientifically proven that a Spanish child who learns English, for example, while abroad or with a native teacher during his early years, will undoubtedly achieve a magnificent accent, unlike a pupil who learns English as an adult, who may reach a high degree of competence at the syntactic and vocabulary level, but will hardly surpass the quality of pronunciation of the previous case. and reach adulthood. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, the "self-motivation" is a clear factor that we can find to learn a language, because the student to learn has to learn to know diverse ways in which he can learn since only this way he will be able to improve his learning and his abilities at the time of being in the classroom.</p>
          </article>

          <article>
            <h3 id="learning-styles">Learning styles</h3>
            <p>We can use some learning styles and strategies to learn a &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; language. Depending on your goal can you learn a language in the time you are expecting to learn it. &nbsp;As in any great endeavor, we have to be very clear about what you really want. The motivation is very important because it increases the likelihood that you will abandon your language learning efforts is very high.</p>
<p>Now comes the motivation part, if we don&rsquo;t have so much motivation to learn a language, it would be easier to abandon the objective. For those times it pays to know exactly why you have decided to learn that language. Even if you have a clear idea when you start, you should write down your motivation.</p>
<p>The study's findings also indicate that having access to information about the preferred learning styles of most students is helpful for teachers when teaching, but all things considered it is very difficult to do studies for any one student and for the teacher to implement in the classroom. &nbsp;</p>

  <h3 id="strategies">Strategies to learn difficult languages</h3>
  <p>Mendoza Gonzalez (2019) found some strategies that Japanese students used to learn Spanish: Taking notes, asking native speakers and friends, watching movies, listening to the music and radio (p.55). These strategies are related to being involved with the language the most time as possible to acquire more vocabulary and practice the listening and speaking skills.</p>
  <p>Some strategies that we can use to increase our motivation and improve our language learning are: Lose your fear of public speaking, before putting any other advice into practice, start by getting rid of the embarrassment, look for resources that are in the language you are learning like music, books, movies, series, podcasts or magazine articles. Surround yourself with people who speak the language you are learning, talking, and speaking in the new language is a key aspect of your process. Don't be afraid to make mistakes, we know that interacting with people in a language you are just learning can be challenging, but it is a challenge you should take on. Think about the new language, we know this is difficult to put into practice, as we are surrounded by people who speak our language. Besides, it is quite tempting to be able to speak in our mother tongue.</p>
  <p>It is also worth mentioning that the importance of motivation in learning is indisputable. Motivation is a major ingredient in learning. It directly affects performance and helps knowledge to be acquired more quickly and easily. This happens because motivation is only considered at the beginning of the process.</p>

          <article>
            <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In conclusion, we can see how important it is to analyze how a language is studied and acquired and what are its pros and cons. Some languages can be more difficult than others because the languages have different structure and origin, and also the linguistic and cultural distance influences in how difficult a language is, as it was seen in the literature review examples. It is important to know which factors can benefit us to be able to learn it and which are the most difficult languages. We must also remember that by setting a goal and achieving it we can learn a new language, we are all capable of achieving our goals and with a little motivation we can speak and understand it.</p>

Linguistic Distance: A Quantitative Measure of the Distance Between English and Other Languages. <em>Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development</em>, 26(1), 1&ndash;11. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14790710508668395">https://doi.org/10.1080/14790710508668395</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This article is about the linguistic distance that makes it difficult for English speakers to learn another language. It is said that it cannot be measured qualitatively or quantitatively, but it is developed a quantitative scale to analyze the difficulty of learning other languages. Language distance differs by country of origin, language influence, migration causes, family trees, prior knowledge (if previously taught in schools), geographic distance, purpose for learning the language, etc.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This article is about English as a universal language for science and the problems it has for people who are not native English speakers and therefore may miss opportunities that create barriers in their professional careers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Also, it explains the reasons why English has become a language that has a good vocabulary for science that sometimes is not in other languages, and we can better describe what we want to expose because it is "precise and direct".</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In this study is shown the results of a survey where the most difficult aspects of Chinese for Chinese learners in the UK were evaluated using a survey divided in 3 parts: Information about the student's learning (self-assessment, learning styles, age, etc). The second part assessed their language skills (speaking, reading, listening and writing) and in the third part they rated how difficult they found the 34 most difficult aspects of Chinese on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.The aspects were divided into Grammar, Aural Reception, Words, Pronunciation, Oral production, and Recall.</p>
